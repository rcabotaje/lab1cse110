# Me as a Programmer


Hi my name is <ins> Rommel</ins> and **I am a 3rd Year _Computer Engineering_ student at UCSD.**

My favorite Programming language is ~~C~~ Java.

Outside of academic related thing I work at a Grocery Store in Point Loma and I like to go bowling and play tennis with my friends. :D

A quote I like is from my dad:
> dont be lazy doing something that takes 30 minutes

Here is a W code:
```
System.out,println(bruh); //idk what to put as code
```
This is built on GitHub Pages here is the [Main Repository](https://github.com/rcabotaje/lab1cse110)

[Here](README.md) is the READme.md file for the Repo
